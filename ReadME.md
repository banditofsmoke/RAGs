Certainly! Here's a detailed README for the `src/RAGs/` directory, including explanations for the ReadWriteSymbolCollector and the newly created `task_1.py`:

# RAGs (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Tools

This directory contains various tools and utilities for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks, including document processing, chunking, and storage.

## Contents

1. [ReadWriteSymbolCollector](#readwritesymbolcollector)
2. [PythonFileWriter](#pythonfilewriter)
3. [task_1.py: Document Processor](#task_1py-document-processor)

## ReadWriteSymbolCollector

The `ReadWriteSymbolCollector` is a utility class for reading and writing symbol table JSON files. It provides functionality to manage and manipulate JSON data structures.

### Key Features:

- Write storage dictionaries to JSON files
- Read JSON dictionaries from files
- Combine JSON dictionary files

### Usage:

```python
from ReadWriteSymbolCollector_lite import ReadWriteSymbolCollector

collector = ReadWriteSymbolCollector()

# Writing to a JSON file
collector.WriteStorageDictJson(writeJsonPath, portionOneDict, portionTwoDict, fileName)

# Reading from a JSON file
data = collector.ReadJsonDict(readJsonPath)

# Combining JSON files
collector.CombineJsonDictFiles(frontJsonData, backJsonData, writeJsonPath, fileName)
```

## PythonFileWriter

The `PythonFileWriter` class is an extension of the `ReadWriteSymbolCollector` with some modifications and additional functionality.

### Key Features:

- Write dictionaries to JSON files
- Read JSON dictionaries from files
- Combine JSON dictionary files

### Usage:

```python
from PythonFileWriter import PythonFileWriter

writer = PythonFileWriter()

# Writing to a JSON file
writer.WriteStorageDictJson(writeJsonPath, portionOneDict, portionTwoDict, fileName)

# Reading from a JSON file
data = writer.ReadJsonDict(readJsonPath)

# Combining JSON files
writer.CombineJsonDictFiles(frontJsonData, backJsonData, writeJsonPath, fileName)
```

## task_1.py: Document Processor

`task_1.py` contains a `DocumentProcessor` class that provides functionality for chunking and indexing documents, assigning unique identifiers, and storing them in a PostgreSQL database.

### Key Features:

- Parse XML documents into a JSON-like structure
- Chunk documents and assign SHA256 hash identifiers
- Store documents and chunks in a PostgreSQL database
- Retrieve chunks by ID or document ID

### Usage:

```python
from task_1 import DocumentProcessor

db_config = {
    "dbname": "your_database",
    "user": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password",
    "host": "localhost"
}

processor = DocumentProcessor(db_config)

# Process XML documents
xml_content = """
<documents>
<document index="1">
        <source>example.txt</source>
        <document_content>This is an example document.</document_content>
        </document>
</documents>
"""
processor.process_xml_documents(xml_content, chunk_size=50)

# Retrieve chunks for a document
document_id = processor.generate_hash("This is an example document.")
chunks = processor.get_chunks_by_document_id(document_id)

processor.close()
```

## Setup and Dependencies

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install psycopg2
   ```
3. Set up a PostgreSQL database and update the `db_config` in your scripts accordingly.
